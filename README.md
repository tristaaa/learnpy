1. bisectionSearch_1.py

    get the guess square root of x which is greater than 1
2. bisectionSearch_2.py

    get the guess square root of x which is a positive fraction
```
Thus, 
* the Bisection Search converges on the order of $\log_2 N$ steps
* Bisection Search works when value of function varies monotonically with input```
